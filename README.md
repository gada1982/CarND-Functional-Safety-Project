# Introduction
This project is done as a part of the Nanodegree *Self-Driving Car Engineer* provided by Udacity. The goal of this project is to create functional safety documents for a simplified lane assistance system. From the point of view of a functional safety manager, a functional safety case is analyzed. A safety case is a collection of documents that demonstrate that a project has made a vehicle safer.

# Final documents
The following documents were created as a result of the Functional Safety Project:
